STEP 3 - Providing data with ProductContext

Now that we've created our ProductContext we can import into our App.js. Now we can start providing data across our application!

Wrap all of your components/routes in App.js inside of ProductContext.Provider component.

Next pass a value prop to your Provider.

In the value prop we'll pass in the products state, and an addItem function that will allow us to add books to the cart.

<ProductContext.Provider value={{ products, addItem }}>
Now that we're providing our products state and addItem function we can refactor our products route to no longer use render props.
Before

<Route
  exact
  path="/"
  render={() => <Products products={products} addItem={addItem} />}
/>
AFTER

<Route exact path="/" component={Products} />
After refactoring you'll notice a few errors... Don't worry we'll clean those up shortly!
STEP 4 - Consuming data with ProductContext

Now that our ProductContext is now providing data we can finally consume it! To do so let's head over to our Products component and import the useContext hook as well as our ProductContext.

In the component, call the useContext hook and pass in the context object we want to use into it.

When we do this, useContext is going to return value passed by our ProductContext Provider value prop. In our case we're getting back an object with two properties. A products property and a addItem property. We can go ahead and destructure those.

const { products, addItem } = useContext(ProductContext);
Now that we have all of the data we need we can refactor our Products component from using props.

To do so we just need to remove every instance of props.

Remove it from the function parameters
Remove it from the products map
Remove it from addItem prop
Now our Products component is getting it's data solely from Context API ðŸ˜ƒ.

STEP 5 - Create the CartContext

Now that we have refactored our Products component to utilize Context API let's refactor our Cart and Navigation Component to use Context API as well.

To start create a new file in our contexts folder named CartContext.js, this context is going to be utilized by our ShoppingCart and Navigation component.

Inside of our new CartContext import createContext and create a new context named CartContext.

STEP 5 - Providing data with CartContext

Let's go ahead and bring our newly created CartContext into our App.js and wrap all of our components inside of our CartContext.Provider. Make sure our ProductContext.Provider is still the root provider.

Now pass a value prop to our CartContext.Provider, this value prop is going to contain our cart state.

Now that we're providing our cart data, we can start to refactor our Navigation and ShoppingCart components.

Let's start with our ShoppingCart component first. Go ahead and refactor the ShoppingCart route to no longer use render props. This will throw us an error, but we'll be able to resolve it quickly.

While were at it let's go ahead and remove the props from our navigation as well.

STEP 7 - The final stretch

Our cart data is now being provided to us from our CartContext time to consume it!

First, let's head to our ShoppingCart component and import the useContext hook and our CartContext.

Now in the component, pass CartContext to the useContext hook and assign it to a variable named cart.

Inside of our component we now need to remove all instances of props.

Remove the props parameter
Remove the props portion in our getCartTotal function
Remove props when we're mapping over our cart
Time to do the same thing for our Navigation component.

First import the useContext hook and our CartContext
Next, pass our CartContext to the useContext hook and assign it to a variable named cart.
Lastly we need to remove all instances of props
Remove props from our parameters
Remove props from our cart length
We have now successfully converted our application into using Context API ðŸ”¥

MVP Requirements:
Create a ProductContext and a CartContext
Use the Provider Component from ProductContext and CartContext to provide data to child components
Consume data using the useContext hook from ProductContext and CartContext
Stretch Problems
Do not attempt stretch problems until MVP has been reached and a final commit has been made.

Create a removeItem function that allows you to remove an item from your cart with a click of a button. This removeItem function should be able to be consumed from your ShoppingCartItem component. Remember each item has an id this will help out a lot while creating your removeItem function!

	Persist Cart Items using localStorage. (If you try this one, it will be a bit tricky to get our items to populate the shopping cart on a refresh.You'll have to think about where the data actually lives, and how you can get data there from localStorage when the app is being mounted after a refresh. Good luck!)
